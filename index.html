	<img src="images/myself.jpg"/>
	<p>I was born November 18th 1976 in the city of <a href="more about cordoba.html" target="blank" > CÃ³rdoba </a>, Argentina. 
		My parents Roberto and Sara, and 3 sisters, Cecilia, Gabriela and Veronica. 
		<br/>In 2003 my wife and I started dating and December 9th of 2006 we got married and have had a beautifull Jupa ceremony and an unforgetable party.
		<br/>On April 18th was born our sweety baby Eliana and on February 24th was born our boy Natan.<br/> After many years of thinking the idea of Alia, 
		we concreted it on December 7th 2017. Now our new life is here in Israel and we are so happy of taking this enormus step.
